Memory Matching Tile Game - Made with C and SDL2

This is a simple puzzle game where players flip tiles to reveal and match hidden pairs. Developed in C using the SDL2 library, the game features a grid of tiles that are randomly placed. Players click to flip two tiles, and if they match, the pair stays revealed. The game includes smooth animations, mouse input support, and a scoring system to track progress. It's a great demonstration of memory-based gameplay with dynamic rendering using SDL2.
